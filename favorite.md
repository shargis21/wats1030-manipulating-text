My Favorite Editor

Its hard to say exactly which one of these editors is my favorite. Inititially I really liked Nano,
then I did Vi and I liked that a lot too, and then I did emacs and I really did not like emacs
that much. I am currently writing this on Nano so I suppose that I might like that the most right
now. I actually really do like Vi, even though it might be an older one. At first I didn't like
that you had to go into insert mode to make changes, but then I realized how much quicker you can
navigate around the text with the keyboard shortcuts and then just go into the insert mode and make
the changes. I'm sure as I navigate around through the rest of the quarter, my preferences for
text editor will change. Once I started going with this assignment, I still am really enjoying
using the command line!
